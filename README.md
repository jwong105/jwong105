### Hey, I'm Jenn! 👋

I'm currently in my 4th year at the University of British Columbia pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science!

Fun fact: 
- ✨I'm obsessed with puzzles✨ Like actually. I have stacks of puzzle boxes. I just need a good movie playlist and my puzzles and you'll never see me again. All my money goes towards puzzles and buying frames for my puzzles :)
