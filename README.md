### Hey, I'm Jenn! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently in my 4th year at the University of British Columbia pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science. This is actually my second undergraduate degree... the first being in Biochemistry. Watch me be in school forever ðŸ˜„

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

âš¡ Fun fact: I love âœ¨puzzlesâœ¨ so much. Like actually. I just need a good movie playlist and my puzzles and you'll never see me again. All my money goes towards puzzles and buying frames for my puzzles :)
